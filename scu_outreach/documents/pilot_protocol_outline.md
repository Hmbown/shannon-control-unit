# SCU 7B Pilot Protocol - 2 Page Outline

## Page 1: Executive Summary

### Header
**Shannon Control Unit: 7B Validation Pilot**  
*Achieving 10-15% faster time-to-target perplexity through automated regularization*

### Hero Box (Visual)
| Metric | Baseline | SCU | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Perplexity (1B) | 15.14 | 12.78 | **-15.6%** |
| Time-to-14.0 ppl | 100% | ~85% | **~15% faster** |
| Manual tuning | Required | **Eliminated** | ∞ |

### The Problem (2 sentences)
Current LLM training requires expensive hyperparameter sweeps that waste compute. Teams spend weeks tuning λ (weight decay) for each new model size, dataset, or objective.

### Our Solution (3 sentences)
The Shannon Control Unit (SCU) uses a closed-loop PI controller to automatically adjust regularization strength during training. It maintains a target information ratio (S* = ParamBPT/(DataBPT+ParamBPT)) inspired by Minimum Description Length principles. Like cruise control for your car, SCU maintains optimal training dynamics without manual intervention.

### Proven Results
- **Llama-3.2-1B**: 15.6% perplexity reduction at fixed compute
- **Method**: Real-time λ adjustment via bounded PI control
- **Overhead**: <1% step-time increase (measured)
- **Integration**: 50 lines of code, works with any optimizer

### Pilot Proposal
**Compute:** 16-32× H100s for 72-96 hours  
**Model:** Standard 7B architecture (Llama-style)  
**Success Criteria:** ≥10% improvement in time-to-target perplexity vs. tuned baseline

### Value at Scale
For organizations spending $1B+ annually on training:
- 10% efficiency = $100M+ saved
- Compound across all experiments
- Reduce time-to-market for new models

### Experimental Design

**Baseline Setup**
- Model: 7B parameters, standard transformer
- Dataset: Your standard mixture
- Optimizer: AdamW with cosine schedule
- Regularization: Grid search λ ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2}

**SCU Setup**
- Same model, data, optimizer
- SCU target: S* = 1.0% (proven optimal at 1B/3B)
- Controller gains: Kp=0.5, Ki=0.1 (pre-tuned)
- No manual λ tuning required

### Metrics & Monitoring

**Primary Metrics**
1. **Time-to-target perplexity**: Hours to reach baseline's final perplexity
2. **Tokens-to-target**: Total tokens processed to reach target
3. **Final perplexity**: Held-out validation after fixed tokens

**Secondary Metrics**
- Step-time overhead (target: <2%)
- S(t) tracking accuracy (±0.2pp)
- λ(t) stability (no oscillations)
- Memory overhead (<100MB)

### Timeline (72-96 hours)

**Hour 0-12: Setup & Verification**
- Environment setup, data loading
- Baseline model initialization
- SCU integration testing
- Profiler baselines

**Hour 12-60: Main Runs**
- Run 1: Baseline with best known λ
- Run 2: SCU with S*=1.0%
- Run 3: Replication seed
- Continuous monitoring

**Hour 60-72: Analysis**
- Generate comparison plots
- Statistical significance tests
- Profiler analysis
- Initial report

**Hour 72-96: Buffer**
- Additional seeds if needed
- Ablation studies
- Final documentation

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Fallback |
|------|------------|----------|
| SCU overhead >2% | Pre-profiled, optimized | Reduce update frequency |
| No improvement | Validated on 1B/3B | Try S* ∈ {0.5%, 1.5%} |
| Integration issues | Simple PyTorch hooks | We provide support |
| Instability | Bounded controller | Can disable mid-run |

### Deliverables
