## Email Body

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company]'s recent work on [specific model/paper]. Impressive scale.

We just achieved **15.6% perplexity reduction** on Llama-3.2-1B using our Shannon Control Unitâ€”essentially cruise control for LLM regularization. No more manual hyperparameter tuning.

**The math for [Company]:**
- Your ~$XXM annual training spend
- 10-15% efficiency gain = $XX-XXM saved
- ROI positive in first run

**Low-risk pilot proposal:**
- 16-32 H100s for 72-96 hours
- We provide: SCU integration, monitoring, analysis
- You provide: Compute + standard 7B setup
- Success = 10%+ faster time-to-target perplexity

Worth a 30-minute technical discussion?

Hi [Name],

Last checkâ€”we're selecting our pilot partner next week.

[Company] would be ideal given your scale and technical depth.
