# Shannon Control Unit - 1-Page Summary

## The Problem
LLM training wastes massive compute on manual hyperparameter tuning. Teams spend weeks finding optimal regularization settings for each model.

## Our Solution
The Shannon Control Unit (SCU) uses closed-loop control theory to automatically adjust regularization during training. No manual tuning required.

## Proven Results
**Llama-3.2-1B Validation:**
- Baseline: {{ results.baseline_ppl }} perplexity ({{ results.baseline_bpt }} BPT)
- With SCU: {{ results.scu_ppl }} perplexity ({{ results.scu_bpt }} BPT)
- Improvement: {{ results.improvement_pct }}% reduction

## How It Works
1. Set target information ratio S* (e.g., 1.0%)
2. SCU measures actual S every step
3. PI controller adjusts λ to maintain target
4. Training stays optimal without manual intervention

## 7B Pilot Proposal
- Compute: {{ pilot.compute_needed }}
- Duration: {{ pilot.duration }}
- Success: ≥{{ pilot.success_threshold }} faster to baseline perplexity
- Overhead: <{{ pilot.overhead_target }} step-time increase

## Business Impact
For $1B annual training spend:
- 10% efficiency = $100M saved
- No more hyperparameter sweeps
- Faster time-to-market

## Next Steps
1. Schedule technical discussion
2. Run {{ pilot.duration }} pilot
3. Publish results if successful
