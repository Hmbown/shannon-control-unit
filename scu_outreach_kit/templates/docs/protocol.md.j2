# {{ org.name }} - 7B Pilot Protocol

## Executive Summary
Validate {{ results.improvement_pct }}% training efficiency improvement at 7B scale using Shannon Control Unit (SCU).

## Background
- Proven: {{ results.baseline_ppl }} → {{ results.scu_ppl }} perplexity on Llama-3.2-1B
- Method: PI controller maintains target information ratio S*
- Benefit: Eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning

## Pilot Design

### Resources
- Compute: {{ pilot.compute_needed }}
- Duration: {{ pilot.duration }}
- Seeds: 2-3 for variance measurement

### Metrics
1. Primary: Time-to-target perplexity (hours to reach baseline)
2. Secondary:
   - Tokens-to-target
   - Step-time overhead (target <{{ pilot.overhead_target }})
   - Cross-seed variance

### Success Criteria
≥{{ pilot.success_threshold }} reduction in time-to-target vs tuned baseline

## Timeline
- Day 1: Environment setup, baseline run
- Day 2-3: SCU runs with telemetry
- Day 4: Analysis and report

## Deliverables
- Performance comparison report
- Telemetry logs (S*, λ, BPT curves)
- Profiler traces
- If successful: Co-authored public case study

## Risk Mitigation
- Can disable SCU anytime without training restart
- Overhead monitored continuously
- Fallback to baseline if issues
