Subject: Re: 15% faster LLM training - quick update on 3B progress

Hi {{ contact.name }},

Quick update: Our 3B validation is showing consistent S* tracking with <{{ pilot.overhead_target }} overhead.

I've attached our 2-page pilot protocol with specific metrics and timeline for the 7B validation on your cluster.

The pilot would demonstrate {{ pilot.success_threshold }}+ improvement in time-to-target perplexity - directly reducing your customers' training costs.

15 minutes to discuss cluster requirements? {{ org.calendly }}

Thanks,
