Subject: Final check - 7B pilot slots filling up

Hi {{ contact.name }},

We're selecting our pilot partner next week. {{ contact.company }} would be ideal given your H100 IB infrastructure.

Recent progress:
• 3B showing stable control dynamics
• Step-time overhead confirmed <{{ pilot.overhead_target }}
• Ready to validate at 7B scale

The pilot remains low-risk: {{ pilot.duration }}, standard benchmarks, can abort anytime.

If successful (≥{{ pilot.success_threshold }} improvement), we'll co-publish the efficiency gains.

Last chance to discuss?
