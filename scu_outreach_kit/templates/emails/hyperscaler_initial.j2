Subject: 15% faster LLM training on your H100s - 7B pilot validation

Hi {{ contact.name }},

I'm {{ org.founder }}, founder of {{ org.name }}. We achieved {{ results.improvement_pct }}% perplexity reduction on Llama-3.2-1B using the Shannon Control Unit - closed-loop control for LLM training.

The SCU eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning by maintaining a target information ratio during training. Think cruise control for regularization.

Results on 1B:
• Baseline: {{ results.baseline_ppl }} perplexity
• With SCU: {{ results.scu_ppl }} perplexity
• Improvement: {{ results.improvement_pct }}% reduction

Proposed 7B pilot on {{ contact.company }} infrastructure:
• Resources: {{ pilot.compute_needed }} for {{ pilot.duration }}
• Success metric: ≥{{ pilot.success_threshold }} faster time-to-target
• Overhead target: <{{ pilot.overhead_target }}
• Deliverable: Public case study co-branded with {{ contact.company }}

Can we discuss a pilot? Book 30 minutes: {{ org.calendly }}

Best,
{{ org.founder }}
