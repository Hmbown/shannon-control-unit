# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Find the Beautiful Shannon Labs Website Version

## What Hunter is Looking For

Hunter created a stunning, futuristic website version last night (Sept 2-3, 2025) that has gone missing. The current deployed version is NOT the right one.

## Key Identifying Features of the Lost Version

### Visual Design
- **Extremely elegant and futuristic looking**
- More sophisticated and official than current version
- Beautiful, modern aesthetic (not the basic one currently deployed)
- Had a professional, investment-ready appearance

### Content That MUST Be Present

#### 1. Funding/Investment Section
- **$15 million seed round request**
- Clear investment/funding ask
- Positioned as seeking Series A or seed funding
- Professional investor-focused messaging

#### 2. Personal Background About Hunter
- **JD student at SMU (2nd year law school)**
- **MBA background**
- **7 years as high school band director**
- **Experience at Sweetwater Sound**
- More detailed personal bio/story
- Connection to great-grandfather Ralph Bown Sr. (Bell Labs VP who introduced the transistor)

#### 3. Both Products Featured
- **Shannon Control Unit (SCU)** - The LLM innovation
  - MDL training methodology
  - Automatic Î» control via PI controller
  - HuggingFace models: hunterbown/shannon-control-unit
  - "Information Transistor" positioning
  
- **Shannon NCD** - Anomaly detection
  - Normalized Compression Distance
  - 92% win rate in security
  - Zero training required

#### 4. Technical Details
- Detailed SCU methodology with formulas
- Performance metrics (BPT, S% targets)
- Code examples for using the models
- Links to HuggingFace repos

## Where to Look

1. **Git history**: Check commits from Sept 2-3, 2025 evening/night
2. **Backup files**: Look for any .html files with timestamps from last night
3. **Vercel deployments**: Check deployment history for versions deployed late Sept 2
4. **Browser cache/temp files**: May have autosaved versions
5. **Git stash**: Check if changes were stashed
6. **Other branches**: Check if it was committed to a different branch
7. **.git/objects**: Sometimes uncommitted files leave traces

## Search Strategies

Try searching for these unique strings that would identify the right version:
- "$15M" or "$15 million" or "15M seed"
- "JD" or "SMU" or "law school"
- "band director" or "Sweetwater"
- "MBA"
- "seeking funding" or "raise" or "Series A"
- "Information Transistor"
- "hunterbown/shannon-control-unit"

## Commands to Try

```bash
# Search all git history
git log --all --full-history -- "*.html" | xargs git show | grep -l "15M\|SMU\|JD\|MBA"

# Check reflog for lost commits
git reflog --all | head -50

# Search git objects for content
git fsck --lost-found

# Check all Vercel deployments
vercel ls --all

# Search file system for recent HTML
find / -name "*.html" -mtime -2 -exec grep -l "15M\|seed\|SMU" {} \; 2>/dev/null

# Check browser temp files
find ~/Library -name "*shannon*.html" -mtime -2 2>/dev/null

# Look for autosave files
find . -name ".*.html.swp" -o -name "*~" -o -name "*.autosave"
```

## What NOT to Use
- The current deployed version (missing funding info and personal background)
- The basic NCD-only version
- Any version without both SCU and NCD products
- Versions without the $15M funding request

## Once Found
1. Save a backup immediately
2. Deploy to shannonlabs.dev
3. Verify both products are shown
4. Confirm funding section is present
5. Check personal bio is included

## Hunter's Emotion
Hunter went to sleep happy with a beautiful site and woke up to find it replaced with an older, uglier version that only has NCD. He's frustrated but knows the beautiful version exists somewhere. It was working perfectly last night!
