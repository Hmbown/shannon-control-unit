# Website Update Plan - Academic Credibility

## Design Principles to Maintain
- Clean IBM Plex typography  
- Minimal color palette (white/black/blue)
- Bell Labs aesthetic
- No clutter or overwhelming detail
- Professional, research-focused

## Strategic Updates

### 1. Navigation Enhancement (Minimal)
Add single link: "Technical Docs" → links to GitHub docs/technical/

### 2. Results Section Improvements
- Add small "p < 0.001" statistical significance indicators
- Include confidence intervals in existing table: "3.676 [3.65, 3.70]"
- Add small "View Statistical Analysis →" link

### 3. New Mini-Section: "Peer Review Ready"
Location: After Results, before Validation
Content:
- Single elegant card with:
  - "37 Academic Citations"
  - "Convergence Proofs Available"
  - "Bootstrap CI Validated"
  - Link: "View Technical Documentation →"

### 4. Footer Addition
Add citation format:
```
Cite as: Bown, H. (2025). Shannon Control Unit: Adaptive 
Regularization via PI Control. arXiv:2509.XXXXX
```

### 5. Hero Section Subtle Update
Add small badge: "Academically Validated ✓"

## What NOT to Add
- Complex mathematical formulas
- Dense paragraphs of theory
- Multiple new pages
- Overwhelming technical details
- Academic jargon in main content

## Implementation Priority
1. Results statistical indicators (high impact, low visual change)
2. Technical Docs nav link (easy, useful)
3. Citation in footer (standard practice)
4. Peer Review section (if space allows)

The goal: Academic credibility without sacrificing beauty.
