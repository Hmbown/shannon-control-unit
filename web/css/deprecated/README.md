# Deprecated CSS Files

These CSS files have been deprecated as part of the website redesign (September 2025).

## Deprecated Files:
- `animations.css` - Excessive animations removed for cleaner design
- `design-system-v2.css` - Old design system with compression effects
- `design-system.css` - Original design system with Art Deco elements  
- `typography.css` - Typography now embedded in main styles

## Current Approach:
The website now uses inline styles in each HTML file for better performance and maintainability. The clean, professional design follows a Stripe/Linear/Vercel aesthetic with:
- Minimal color palette (black/white/blue)
- System fonts
- Subtle shadows only
- No animated backgrounds
- Clear typography hierarchy

## Active CSS:
- `clean-design.css` - Dark theme for data-heavy pages (optional)
- Inline styles in HTML files - Primary styling approach

The redesign focuses on technical credibility and lets the benchmark results speak for themselves.
